# Accordion

Accordion is a simple music maker application intended for game developers. This project is intended to fill a gap in the music creation market that is between *super* simple music creation apps that do give the user options to diversify their music and lock users into a single genre, and complex music creation software that is inaccessible to average people who do not specialize in music creation.

## Goals

The key goals for this project include:
 - Have a program that is very intuitive and not overly complicated
 - Give the user the ability to make complex music by giving them the option to delve deeper.
 - Have interesting features like sound effects and custom instruments that allow the music being created to be diverse.
