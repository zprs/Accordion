# Accordion

Accordion is a simple music maker application intended for game developers. This project is intended to fill a gap in the music creation market that is between *super* simple music creation apps that do give the user options to diversify their music and lock users into a single genre, and complex music creation software that is inaccessible to average people who do not specialize in music creation.

## Goals

The key goals for this project include:
 - Have a program that is very intuitive and not overly complicated
 - Give the user the ability to make complex music by giving them the option to delve deeper.
 - Have interesting features like sound effects and custom instruments that allow the music being created to be diverse.
## Roadmap

The complete roadmap can be found on my [Trello board](https://trello.com/b/kii3M7bS/accordion).

Here is a general overview:

|Alpha| Beta |Release|
|--|--|--|
|Include functionality for general music creation including: placing and removing notes, saving and opening files, instrument changing and section arrangement|Include general features like undo and redo, scale changes, exporting files, etc. | Add more advanced features such as custom instruments, sound effects, and overall make the application look and preform cleanly.
